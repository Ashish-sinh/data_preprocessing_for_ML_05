This notebook demonstrates how to perform hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models using various optimization techniques. Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the machine learning workflow to find the best set of hyperparameters that optimize the performance of the model.

## Contents

- Introduction: Brief overview of hyperparameter tuning and its importance in machine learning.
- Grid Search: Exhaustive search over a predefined hyperparameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
- Random Search: Randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from a predefined search space for optimization.
- Auto Hyperparameter Tuning: Demonstrates automatic hyperparameter tuning using the Optuna library.
- Example: A practical example demonstrating hyperparameter tuning on a sample dataset.

## How to Use

1. Install the Required Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed by running the following command:
